# Getting started with Astra

### Quick start

**1. Create a new html file**. Astra needs the meta name="viewport" tag to work well with responsive webpages. Here is a template that you can copy:

Let's start by including Astra to our webpage. We need to import the production-ready CSS and JavaScript via CDN links.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
        <title>Astra Initial Template</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

**2. Add the CDN links.** Here is the previous template with the CDN links:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ImLecus/Astra@0.4-alpha/src/astra.min.css">
        <title>Astra Initial Template</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello world!</h1>
        <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/ImLecus/Astra@0.4-alpha/src/astra.min.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

**3. Start coding!** That's all that you need to start creating with Astra. The documentation has all the information that you need to use every feature that Astra has for you.
