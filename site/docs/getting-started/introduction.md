# Get started with Astra

To start creating we need a `html` file. Additionally, Astra needs Astra needs `<meta charset="utf-8">` and `<meta name="viewport">` tags to work well with responsive design. Here is a new html file template that you can copy:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
        <title>Astra Initial File</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
        <title>Astra Initial File</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="...">
